    Why use UUIDs as upload paths?

    Link: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-uuid-upload-path/1.0.0
    Django tries to ensure that all your uploaded files are given unique names on the filesystem.
    It does this by checking if a file with the same name exists before saving a new one, and adding
    a suffix if the new file would otherwise conflict with the existing one.

    If you’re saving files to disk using the built-in django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage,
    this isn’t much of a problem. However, if you’re using a cloud file storage, such as
    storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage, this uniqueness check can have a noticeable effect on the
    performance of file uploads. Worse, the default configuration of S3BotoStorage is to overwrite existing
    files with the same name when uploading a new file!
    By generating a unique filename for each uploaded file, django-uuid-upload-path removes the need for a         costly uniqueness check, and avoids accidentally overwriting existing files on remote cloud storages.

    It will generate the string of ( like etc: '3x2LRbdHSa29vLzdhgKsvg') length 22.
    return string (etc: 3x2LRbdHSa29vLzdhgKsvg)
